## Hi there 👋

### 🚀About Me

I am Izaya Pantovich and I'm experienced in sales, advertising, coding, support, helping, and idea making, all the things I'm experienced I have done for 4+ years.

Apart from being a bunch of stuff, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter I stay inside, I hate the cold. During the warmer months here in NC, I enjoy biking, hanging out with friends and family, and playing video games.

When forced indoors, I follow a number of movies and television shows, I am an not to bad chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.
